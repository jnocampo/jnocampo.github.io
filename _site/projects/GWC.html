<p><strong>What is girls who code?</strong></p>

<p>Girls Who code is a nonprofit organization that aims to help young girls get interested in computer science and get the opportunities in the field.</p>

<p>I spent a good portion of the beginning of the year volunteering and becoming a student aid for a local Girls Who Code program in Honolulu. I have heard of the GWC program since I was in high school myself. It is a great organization that gives young women the opportunity to learn more about computer science.</p>

<p>After taking a few classes at the University of Hawaiâ€™t at Manoa, I had remembered about the clubs back home and was out to search for one locally. I wanted to help give back into a community that promotes women success and education. Being a part of the program helped enrich my knowledge and immerse myself in the younger community and their thoughts and dreams on being a computer scientist!</p>

<p>Some skills I learned while being a part of this program was leadership, creating presentations and reinforcing my own background in programming. What was most enriching was inspiring the young girls and encouraging them that they could do whatever they want. I think I learned more from them than they did me.</p>

<p>Find your local club and help support young girls interested in STEM</p>
