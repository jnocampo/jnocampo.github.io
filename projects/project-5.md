For this project we used Docker to package our application, Django for our web application framework, and bootstrap, CSS, and jQuery for styling. Our database was set up using PostgreSQL, and Heroku to deploy our application. Our team consited of 5 people, and everyone except myself had experience with programming. This project was made during our EE491F: Computer Science course, where it was an elective for Electrical Engineering students. This project provided several challenges for our team. Though I was not familiar with a lot of this tech stack at the beginning of this course, it was interesting to see the progression my team and myself have made over the course of the few weeks this class lasted. It provided me with the opportunity to take control and pair program. It was an interesting learning experience of having this role and transfering my knoweldge down.    

<br>

#### My contribution: 
* Created a full stack marketplace application for UH M¯anoa students that allows users to to interact with each other
using CRUD
* Set up our work environment using docker and django and created models and base templates for pages
* Gave structure and functional style to front-end design by using bootstrap and created responsive user interfaces

<br> 

#### My Takeaways:
* Patience is key!
* Importance of laying down expectations and implementing safe practices during development
* No one gets left behind
* Communication between teammates is extremely vital, make sure everyone is on the same page
