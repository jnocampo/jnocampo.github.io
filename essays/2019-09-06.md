Software engineering is interesting to a fault. I find that is fair to say. Not everything within the wide scope of software engineering peaks my interest. Just like how not every ice cream flavor will taste good to me. But let me be more honest, it is a lot harder for me to find an ice cream flavor that I do not like. A few topics that I find interesting is Web/App Development and Augmented/Virtual Reality and a few ice cream flavors that I love is honey lavender and green tea. 

I see web/app development like getting ice cream at Cold Stone; if you start with vanilla ice cream (web dev), you can easily make your way into making cookies n cream(app dev). Starting with vanilla ice cream(web dev) you will learn techniques that will contribute to making your  cookies n cream(web dev); like your toppings, in this case is, these are making an API(application program interface), making a server, and using different database technologies. From there, what you are missing is your presentation, and that is completely customizable to how you like it and that is the cherry on top! 

Augmented/Virtual reality is something that no one should not be interested in because there is something for everybody. The possible applications you could use augmented/virtuality reality from practicality to pleasure is endless. Virtual reality is creating an immersive artificial environment with software, where a user can experience things as if it were real. I could learn to put myself in an ice cream wonderland; In augmented reality you are putting things from the virtual world in the real world; snapchat filters. With augmented/virtual reality you are creating an experience employing different simulations and using various technologies, software, and algorithms. You are collaborative with different subcategories of software engineering, like UX designers, to create an experience that is tailored for whomever. Those technical applications can improve and make beneficial for said user. 

I aim to gain skills that would allow me to create experiences where I can potentially help someone in more ways than one. To make cookies n cream ice cream from nothing, with all the toppings that I want. I hope to share these experiences with like-minded people who can help me get to where I want because I cannot make a whole new reality without the skills of working together with people within my reality. You cannot learn teamwork, project/time management and good communication skills alone. A good software engineer can recognize they cannot do it all alone.


**So, is software engineering interesting?** 


Yes, because it is just like ice cream and I am pretty cool too.
