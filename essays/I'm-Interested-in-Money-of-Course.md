**Money**. Let's be honest. Money plays a big part of why lots of people would like to be Software Engineers. It is such a broad field and is so versitile on the ways of how you plan your life. It is, the job of this future. It is a good career that will get you that six-figure pay we all want. Most people are money driven and I am too to an extent. I am being real and it plays a big part.


Even with money such as an insentive, there are many aspects of Software Engineering that make me want to keep doing it. A part of who I am is a maker, creator. I like to paint, cook, garden, sew clothes, to do things with my hands and figure things out. That's why I like programming, being a Software Engineer. It challenges my mind to find new and creative ways to make things. Using code as my medium in this case. There is always room for growth and room for more learning opportunities which is something I love. 


When I make things, I do it with purpose. Is what I am making gonna make me feel better, make someone else better. With Software Engineering, I can navigate to doing something that I know can make a difference in a way that I enjoy. I have so much more to learn. Augmented/Virtual reality is something that I am interested in learning. The possible applications you could use augmented/virtuality reality from practicality to pleasure is endless. I hope to still have room for growth and have continual interest for years on.
