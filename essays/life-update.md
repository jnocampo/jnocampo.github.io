I have not been programming for that long, but there are a few things I would like to share with you that I have learned that helped me recognize the importance in using during my journey into becoming a Software Engineer. 

<br>

I will be honest it was not at ***ALL*** easy to get to where I am now. Which is still a decent novice. I really had a hard time following sometimes and vocalizing problems I needed help with. I continue to learn to verbal communicate my steps and work out my thought process. Though I am no master coder, I ***try***. And I think that is all that really matters.

<br>

I used to think all to it took to be a master Software Engineer I needed to just know how to code efficiently and easily. But boy was I wrong.

<br>

My life changed when I discovered configuration management and open source software. I felt like a new door of possibilities was presented in-front of me. Configuration management and open source software enabled me to continue to become an effective developer. It is something that I will continue to use for the rest of my career. It gave me a space to properly manage my work remotely and locally and advance me further. With that, open source software also taught me something invaluable; that without sharing and collaboration we would be gone without many advancements made. It introduces collaboration as innovation, and is something that I should carry with me forever. 

<br>

I also believe there are other crucial topics I have learned that every aspiring engineer should follow, and those topics are: 

<br>
<br>

* Coding Standards
* Design Patterns
* Ethics

<br>
<br>

I say these with the upmost importance because I find that in order to truly become a sucsessful engineer, you need to keep these points in mind. I keep these topics together as they come hand in hand. As an engineer, following a code of ethics is important, these ethics are a set of rules every single of us should follow, and they are presented [here](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) in further detail. 

<br>

A part of ethics are coding standards, and coding standards are essentially a bunch of rules and guidelines that help create clean and better code. They also help you understand code better by also providing you with a set of standards to follow and help collaborators follow and develop. These set of rules also layout the importance of design patterns. Design patterns are beneficial as they provide a reliable structure of how to present your code based on what you are creating. This again reinforces good practice that not only works but again make it easier for collaborators to change and follow. 

<br>

I know I still and always will have a lot to learn, but I do intend on using these practices with me as I know it will help me become the best engineer I can be.
