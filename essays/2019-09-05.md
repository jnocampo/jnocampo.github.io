Javascript more like jaja script amiriteeee? 


<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/haha.jpg">


Let me tell you, I am a FAN. The only other languages I know is java (some jaja), C, and C++. Jajascript is like that girl you wish you met before everyone else. The one who saved you from some heartache and made your life easier and just makes a whole lot more sense. But even though she was not your first, she came at the right time. Java is like your first girlfriend, she taught you so much that prepared you for all the others to come; she was your first.  Whereas C and C++ were just like your on and off girlfriend. You had some history together, and learned to grow from. 

With javascript, I am a newbie. It is a whole lot different than what I am used to. I save more time not having to compile to execute, and worry about declarations to set up what I want. I do appreciate Java, C, and C++ they are beneficial in their own way and similarly too. Javascript is a scripting language, it does not need to be compiled to be executed. It is a great language that people should learn, but not learned first. Without some prior knowledge to programming it can be a messy language to learn not so much to Java though where it is cleaner, and more structured and can help you create better code. 

From my own eyes, I think javascript is both a good and bad programming language. There are a lot of things wrong with javascript that can make a practiced programmers who love their structure, declared variables, and semicolons corck their eyes out and how easy it is to create a bug when your code looks perfectly correct. What makes javascript good is that it is good. Need I say more? My opinion matters.


Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
